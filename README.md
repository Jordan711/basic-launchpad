# Super LaunchPad (Super original name)

Welcome to my launchpad app! This is done as a part of an exercise from the 
- ["Complete Flutter Guide 2024: Build Android, iOS, and Web apps" by Sagnik Bhattacharya](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-the-guide-to-build-android-ios-and-web-apps/)

I did mine differently than the solution given. Instead, I used the Inkwell widget to simulate the clicking effect, and GridView to display the buttons in a grid format.
This is a fun project and I hope to continue making updates, as I continue my learning journey!
